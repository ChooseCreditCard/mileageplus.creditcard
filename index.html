    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is an Alliance-Style Mileage Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A mileage credit card connected to an airline-style loyalty program typically lets you earn miles that can be used not only with one carrier, but often with a wider partner or alliance network. This can unlock more routes, more seat options and more ways to spend your miles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of generic cashback, your spend accumulates in a mileage account. The value you get depends on how you redeem: short-haul economy tickets, long-haul business class, upgrades, or partner flights can all have different value per mile.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning mechanics -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How You Earn Miles Across Airlines & Partners</h2>
      <p>
        Mileage cards usually earn a base rate on all purchases, plus higher earn rates on flights, travel and sometimes partner categories such as hotels or car rentals. Some programs also give extra miles when you book directly through their own portals.
      </p>
      <p>Typical earning features include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li><strong>Base earn rate</strong> on everyday spend (for example, 1x miles).</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus miles</strong> on tickets purchased with the linked airline group.</li>
        <li><strong>Partner bonuses</strong> for hotels, rental cars or travel agencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Welcome bonuses</strong> if you meet a minimum spend within a set period.</li>
        <li><strong>Elite-qualifying activity</strong> where spend can count towards status.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The real value depends on whether your actual spending falls into these bonus buckets, and whether you fly enough to make use of the miles before they expire or the program changes its rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redemption & value -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles in an Alliance Network</h2>
      <p>
        Alliance-style miles are often redeemable across multiple airlines, giving you more routes and schedules to choose from. However, availability and value vary by route, cabin and partner.
      </p>
      <p>Key things to look at:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li><strong>Award charts or dynamic pricing</strong> – how many miles different trips cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Partner surcharges</strong> – some partners add higher fees than others.</li>
        <li><strong>Stopover and open-jaw rules</strong> – can add value on complex trips.</li>
        <li><strong>Change and cancellation policies</strong> – important for long-haul awards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many programs, the “sweet spots” are found on long-haul premium cabins, partners with lower surcharges, or off-peak dates. But that requires some planning and flexibility.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- When it makes sense -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When an Alliance Mileage Card Fits Your Travel Pattern</h2>
      <p>
        Mileage cards tied to broader networks are most useful if:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li>You regularly fly routes served by the alliance and its partners.</li>
        <li>You can plan redemptions in advance and are flexible on dates or carriers.</li>
        <li>You fly long-haul or premium cabins where miles can offset high cash prices.</li>
        <li>You value status perks such as priority boarding, extra baggage or lounge access.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your flying is infrequent, very price-driven, or spread across many unrelated airlines, you may be better off with a general travel-rewards or cashback card instead.
