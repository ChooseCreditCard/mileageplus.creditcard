      Best Cards for Earning MileagePlus Miles
    </a>
  </section>

  <!-- 1. What the program is -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>1. What the MileagePlus Program Is</h2>
    <p>
      MileagePlus is United’s loyalty and rewards program. Members collect miles on United and Star Alliance flights,
      as well as through on-the-ground partners and co-branded credit cards. Those miles can later be redeemed for
      flights, upgrades and other rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program combines:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>A mileage currency</strong> that can be spent on United and partner flights.</li>
      <li><strong>Elite status tiers</strong> which unlock better treatment when you travel.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit card links</strong> that turn everyday spending into additional miles.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 2. How miles are earned -->
  <section id="earning" class="section">
    <h2>2. How MileagePlus Miles Are Earned</h2>
    <p>You can earn MileagePlus miles in several ways:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>United flights</strong> – miles typically based on the fare you pay and your status tier.</li>
      <li><strong>Star Alliance flights</strong> – eligible partner flights credited to your MileagePlus account.</li>
      <li><strong>Co-branded credit cards</strong> – miles per unit of currency spent, often with bonus categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Hotels, car rentals and shopping</strong> – partner activity where you add your MileagePlus number.</li>
      <li><strong>Promotions</strong> – seasonal or targeted offers that provide extra miles on specific routes or actions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Over time, many members find that a large share of their miles comes from credit card spend and partner activity
      rather than from flights alone.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3. How cards boost earnings -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. How Credit Cards Boost MileagePlus Earnings</h2>
    <p>
      MileagePlus-linked credit cards let you earn miles on non-flight purchases and may add practical travel perks.
      Depending on your country, typical card features include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Base earn rates</strong> on all purchases, plus elevated earn rates on United or travel-related spend.</li>
      <li><strong>Welcome bonuses</strong> when you reach a required minimum spend in the first few months.</li>
      <li><strong>Travel benefits</strong> such as priority boarding, free checked bags or airport lounge access.</li>
      <li><strong>Status support</strong> where spending can help with elite qualification metrics in some markets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Used consistently, the right MileagePlus card can make a noticeable difference to how quickly your mileage
      balance grows between trips.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. Redemption categories -->
  <section id="redeem" class="section">
    <h2>4. Redemption Categories in MileagePlus</h2>
    <p>MileagePlus miles can be redeemed for:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Award flights on United</strong> – short- and long-haul itineraries paid with miles plus taxes.</li>
      <li><strong>Star Alliance partner flights</strong> – redemptions that use alliance partners to reach more destinations.</li>
      <li><strong>Seat upgrades</strong> – moving from economy to higher cabins on some tickets and routes.</li>
      <li><strong>Other rewards</strong> – such as hotels, cars or experiences in certain markets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As with most airline programs, many travelers focus their miles on flights and upgrades, where the potential value
      per mile is usually strongest.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. Elite tiers -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. MileagePlus Elite Status Tiers</h2>
    <p>
      MileagePlus offers multiple elite levels. Names and qualification metrics can change over time, but the typical
      structure looks like this:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Member</strong> – entry level with standard earning and redemption.</li>
      <li><strong>Premier Silver</strong> – base elite tier with some priority services and limited upgrades.</li>
      <li><strong>Premier Gold</strong> – stronger upgrade priority and additional travel benefits.</li>
      <li><strong>Premier Platinum</strong> – higher upgrade priority and more generous allowances.</li>
      <li><strong>Premier 1K</strong> – top published tier with the widest range of perks and recognition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Certain co-branded cards can accelerate your path toward these tiers by providing qualifying boosts or waivers,
      depending on the market and product.
